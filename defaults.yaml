    frequencyRange:
      # Frequency range is defined as the complete span
      # of frequency desired in the measurement. Practically
      # the script will use the analysis bandwidth as a step
      # size and compute n discrete frequency blocks to be
      # measured that in aggregate cover the complete desired
      # frequency range.
      # For example take the following parameters:
      #   start = 13.5
      #   end = 15.8
      #   units = GHz
      # Here we will determine the analysis bandwidth from
      # the SCPI interface and choose the first frequency
      # blocks centre frequency as:
      #     start + analysis_bandwidth / 2
      # The second centre frequency will be:
      #     start + 3 * analysis_bandwidth / 2
      # and so on. Assuming an analysis bandwidth of 460 MHz
      # the following array of centre frequencies will be
      # observed:
      #
      # 13.96, 14.42, 14.88, 15.34 GHz
      #
      # An internal check is made to limit the span to
      # only that available from the spectrum analyser.
